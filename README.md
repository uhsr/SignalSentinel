# SignalSentinel: Proactive Signal Integrity Monitoring

SignalSentinel is a robust, TypeScript-based application designed for proactive monitoring and analysis of signal integrity in real-time data streams. It provides a comprehensive framework for identifying anomalies, detecting signal degradation, and generating alerts, enabling developers and operations teams to maintain optimal data quality and system performance. SignalSentinel leverages advanced signal processing techniques and customizable thresholds to adapt to various data types and application requirements.

This project aims to empower developers with a reliable solution for ensuring the integrity of critical data signals. By providing early detection of potential issues, SignalSentinel helps prevent data corruption, reduces debugging time, and minimizes the risk of system failures. Its modular architecture allows for easy integration into existing data pipelines and facilitates the development of custom monitoring solutions tailored to specific use cases. SignalSentinel is built with scalability and maintainability in mind, ensuring long-term reliability and ease of use.

The core functionality of SignalSentinel revolves around configurable signal processing pipelines, allowing users to define custom algorithms for data analysis. This includes features like noise reduction, signal filtering, and statistical analysis. The system also incorporates a sophisticated alerting mechanism that triggers notifications based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection algorithms. These alerts can be customized to be sent via various channels, such as email, Slack, or custom webhooks.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Signal Monitoring:** Continuously monitors incoming data streams and performs real-time analysis to detect anomalies and signal degradation.
*   **Configurable Signal Processing Pipelines:** Allows users to define custom signal processing algorithms using a modular pipeline architecture. These pipelines can be configured using a JSON-based configuration file. For example:
    <pre>
    {
      "pipeline": [
        { "type": "NoiseReduction", "parameters": { "threshold": 0.1 } },
        { "type": "MovingAverage", "parameters": { "windowSize": 10 } }
      ]
    }
    </pre>
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Employs statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns in the signal data. The anomaly detection models can be trained using historical data and dynamically adjusted based on real-time performance.
*   **Customizable Alerting System:** Triggers alerts based on predefined thresholds and anomaly detection results. Alert notifications can be sent via various channels, including email, Slack, and custom webhooks. The alert configuration supports complex filtering rules and escalation policies.
*   **Data Visualization:** Provides interactive dashboards for visualizing signal data and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboards are built using charting libraries and can be customized to display various metrics, such as signal strength, noise levels, and anomaly scores.
*   **Historical Data Analysis:** Stores historical signal data for offline analysis and trend identification. This enables users to identify long-term patterns and predict potential issues. The data can be accessed through an API for integration with other analytical tools.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language, chosen for its strong typing, code maintainability, and scalability.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment, providing a non-blocking, event-driven architecture for high-performance real-time applications.
*   **Express.js:** A web application framework for building robust and scalable APIs.
*   **Redis:** An in-memory data store used for caching and real-time data processing.
*   **PostgreSQL:** A relational database for storing historical signal data and configuration settings.
*   **Jest:** A testing framework for ensuring code quality and reliability through unit and integration tests.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    <pre>
    git clone https://github.com/uhsr/SignalSentinel.git
    </pre>
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    <pre>
    cd SignalSentinel
    </pre>
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    <pre>
    npm install
    </pre>
4.  **Set up the database:** Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the connection settings in the `.env` file.
5.  **Start Redis:** Ensure that Redis is running on your system.
6.  **Build the project:**
    <pre>
    npm run build
    </pre>

## Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and define the following variables:

*   `NODE_ENV`: The environment (development, production, test).
*   `PORT`: The port the application will listen on.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The PostgreSQL database connection string.
*   `REDIS_HOST`: The Redis host address.
*   `REDIS_PORT`: The Redis port number.
*   `ALERT_EMAIL_ADDRESS`: The email address to send alerts from.
*   `ALERT_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: The Slack webhook URL for sending alerts to Slack.

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

<pre>
npm start
</pre>

The application will start listening on the configured port. You can then access the API endpoints and dashboards through your web browser or API client.

Example API endpoint (assuming the application is running on port 3000):

*   `GET /api/signals`: Returns a list of monitored signals.
*   `POST /api/signals`: Adds a new signal to monitor.
*   `GET /api/signals/{signalId}`: Returns details for a specific signal.
*   `GET /api/alerts`: Returns a list of recent alerts.

(Detailed API documentation would be provided as a separate document or within the application itself.)
